### Making Plots

The following creates and runs the shell script which runs plotting configurations

  ```bash
  cd $EWJTAHOME # go to directory where the repository is based
  ShellScripts/Plotting/createRunPlots.sh Configurations/event/Pythia8_AllQCDPhoton_Hydjet_Cymbal_MB_HINPbPbWinter16DR/ 'plot*.conf'
  Configurations/event/Pythia8_AllQCDPhoton_Hydjet_Cymbal_MB_HINPbPbWinter16DR/runPlots.sh # make the plots
  ```
