### Making Plots

The following creates and runs the shell script which runs plotting configurations

  ```bash
  cd $EWJTAHOME # go to directory where the repository is based
  ShellScripts/Plotting/createRunPlots.sh Configurations/HIRun2018PbPb/L1T/L1CaloTower_XeXeRun2017_HIMinimumBias/ 'plot*.conf'
  Configurations/HIRun2018PbPb/L1T/L1CaloTower_XeXeRun2017_HIMinimumBias/runPlots.sh # make the plots
  ```
